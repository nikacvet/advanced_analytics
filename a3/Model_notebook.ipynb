Concurrently, LLM-judges,\\nmodels trained to generate evaluations and critiques (explanations) in natural\\nlanguage, are becoming increasingly popular in automatic evaluation. Despite\\njudge empirical successes, their effectiveness as evaluators in test-time\\nscaling settings is largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce the Judge\\nEvaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark, which evaluates judge\\nperformance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction\\nfollowing) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam\\nsearch, and critique-based response refinement. We evaluate 10 different judge\\nmodels (7B-70B parameters) for 8 different base generator models (6.7B-72B\\nparameters). Our benchmark shows that while judges are competitive with outcome\\nreward models in reranking, they are consistently worse than process reward\\nmodels in beam search procedures. Furthermore, though unique to LLM-judges,\\ntheir natural language critiques are currently ineffective in guiding the\\ngenerator towards better responses.   \n",

The images were processed\\nfor low surface brightness (LSB) science, with additional correction for\\ninstrumental scattering in the short-wavelength channels, and analysed using\\nwavelet-based decomposition. The ICL, brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and\\nsatellite galaxies were extracted and modelled, with 2D maps for each\\ncomponent. ICL and ICL+BCG fractions, computed across all filters within a 400\\nkpc radius, exhibit a flat trend with wavelength, averaging 28% and 34%,\\nrespectively. Flux ratios between the BCG and the next brightest members\\n(M$_{12}$, M$_{13}$ and M$_{14}$) also display minimal wavelength dependence.\\nThese results indicate that SMACS J0723 is a dynamically evolved cluster with a\\ndominant BCG and well-developed ICL. Five prominent ICL substructures are\\nanalysed, contributing to 10-12% of the total ICL+BCG flux budget, slightly\\nexceeding simulation predictions. Their short dynamical timescales suggest an\\ninstantaneous ICL injection rate of several $10^3 L_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$,\\nconsistent with active dynamical assembly. These findings support a scenario\\nwhere SMACS J0723's ICL growth is currently driven by galaxy mergers involving\\nthe BCG and other bright satellites, rather than by the accretion of\\npre-processed ICL from a recent cluster merger. However, extrapolating the\\ncurrent injection rate to the cluster's lifetime indicates that additional\\nmechanisms are required to match the growth observed in other clusters over\\ncosmic times.   \n",

However, grids based on intermittent\\nrenewables are challenged by diurnal and seasonal mismatch between supply of\\nsun and wind and demand for electricity, including for heat pumps and electric\\ntwo and four wheelers. Load management and demand response measures promise to\\nadjust for this mismatch, utilizing information- and price-based approaches to\\nsteer demand towards times with high supply of intermittent renewables. Here,\\nwe systematically review the literature estimating CO2 savings from residential\\nload management in developing and developed nations. We find that load\\nmanagement holds high potential, locally differentiated with energy mix\\n(including the respective share of renewables and fossils), climate zone, and\\nthe regulatory environment and price mechanism. Most identified studies suggest\\na mitigation potential between 1 and 20%. Load management becomes more relevant\\nwith higher shares of intermittent renewables, and when electricity prices are\\nhigh. Importantly, load management aligns consumers' financial incentives with\\nclimate change mitigation, thus rendering accompanying strategies politically\\nfeasible. We summarize key regulatory steps to facilitate load management in\\neconomies and to realize relevant consumer surplus and mitigation potential.   \n",

Due to the\\ninterplay between bath interactions, probe-bath coupling, and activity, the\\nmean squared displacement, velocity, and stationary velocity correlations\\nexhibit different dynamical regimes, which we characterize analytically.

Naive approaches, which estimate the policy gradient\\nin the prompt space, suffer either from variance caused by the large action\\nspace of prompts or bias caused by inaccurate reward predictions. To circumvent\\nthese challenges, we propose a novel kernel-based off-policy gradient method,\\nwhich estimates the policy gradient by leveraging similarity among generated\\nsentences, substantially reducing variance while suppressing the bias.\\nEmpirical results on our newly established suite of benchmarks demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of the proposed approach in generating personalized descriptions\\nfor movie recommendations, particularly when the number of candidate prompts is\\nlarge.   \n",

JWST spectra of four star-forming\\nregions in M51 show an emission feature, with central wavelength\\n$\\sim$4.647$\\mu$m and FWHM 0.0265$\\mu$m, corresponding to the C-D stretching\\nmode in aliphatic hydrocarbons. The emitting aliphatic material is estimated to\\nhave (D/H)$_{\\rm aliph}\\approx 0.17\\pm0.02$ -- a factor $\\sim$$10^4$ enrichment\\nrelative to the overall interstellar medium (ISM). On $\\sim$$50\\,$pc scales,\\ndeuteration levels toward four H$\\,$II regions in M51 are 2-3 times higher than\\nin the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), with implications for the\\nprocesses responsible for the formation and evolution of hydrocarbon\\nnanoparticles, including PAHs. The deuteration of the aliphatic material is\\nfound to anticorrelate with helium ionization in the associated H$\\,$II,\\nsuggesting that harsh FUV radiation may act to lower the deuteration of\\naliphatics in PDRs near massive stars. No evidence is found for deuteration of\\naromatic material, with (D/H)$_{\\rm arom} \\lesssim 0.016$: deuteration of the\\naliphatic material exceeds that of the aromatic material by at least a factor\\n10. The observed levels of deuteration may account for the depletion of D\\nobserved in the Galactic interstellar medium. If so, the $4.65\\mu$m feature may\\nbe detectable in absorption.   \n",

Although previous methods\\nhave significantly progressed, especially in training diffusion models on\\nsensitive images with DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), they still\\nsuffer from unsatisfactory performance. In this work, inspired by curriculum\\nlearning, we propose a two-stage DP image synthesis framework, where diffusion\\nmodels learn to generate DP synthetic images from easy to hard. Unlike existing\\nmethods that directly use DP-SGD to train diffusion models, we propose an easy\\nstage in the beginning, where diffusion models learn simple features of the\\nsensitive images. To facilitate this easy stage, we propose to use `central\\nimages', simply aggregations of random samples of the sensitive dataset.\\nIntuitively, although those central images do not show details, they\\ndemonstrate useful characteristics of all images and only incur minimal privacy\\ncosts, thus helping early-phase model training. We conduct experiments to\\npresent that on the average of four investigated image datasets, the fidelity\\nand utility metrics of our synthetic images are 33.1% and 2.1% better than the\\nstate-of-the-art method.   \n",
      "8  In the present work, we aim to restore Book X of the $\\it{Elements}$ to its\\noriginal Theaetetean, pre-Eudoxean form in two separate ways. First, we restore\\nthe considerable mathematical content of Book X, by correlating Book X with\\nPlato's account of Theaetetus' mathematical discoveries and Plato's imitations\\nof these discoveries for his philosophy. Thus, Theaetetus proved (i) the\\neventual periodicity of the anthyphairesis of lines a to b, satisfying $Ma^2 =\\nNb^2$, for MN not square number; (ii) the eventual periodic anthyphairesis of\\nlines a to b, satisfying more general quadratic expressions, including the\\nApplication of Areas in defect, and employing this to show that the 12 classes\\nof alogoi lines, including the minor, despite being alogoi, are determined by\\nan eventually periodic Application of Areas in defect; (iii) the anthyphairetic\\npalindromic periodicity of the anthyphairesis of the surds $\\sqrt{N}$ for any\\nnon-square number N, of relevance to the general Pell's Diophantine problem.\\nSecondly, we restore the proofs of all propositions of Book X, in such way that\\nthese are proofs based on Theaetetus', and not on Eudoxus' theory of proportion\\nof magnitudes, in particular not making any use of Eudoxus' condition (namely\\nof definition 4 of Book V). The restoration is based on our reconstruction of\\nTheaetetus' theory of proportion for magnitudes, for the limited class of\\nratios a/b such that either a, b are commensurable or the anthyphairesis of a\\nto b is eventually periodic, without employing Eudoxus' condition, and its\\nsuccess provides a confirmation of our reconstruction.\\n  The final version of this paper will appear as a chapter in the journal\\nGanita Bh\\=arat\\=i, Bulletin of the Indian Society for History of Mathematics,\\n(2) 45 (2023).   \n",

This transfers the recently introduced\\nconcept of \\emph{Permissive (qualitative) Strategy Templates} (PeSTels) for\\n$\\omega$-regular games to games with quantitative objectives. We provide the\\ntheoretical and algorithmic foundations of (i) QaSTel synthesis, and (ii) their\\n(incremental) combination with PeSTels for games with mixed quantitative and\\nqualitative objectives. Using a prototype implementation of our synthesis\\nalgorithms, we demonstrate empirically that QaSTels extend the advantageous\\nproperties of strategy templates over single winning strategies -- known from\\nPeSTels -- to games with (additional) quantitative objectives. This includes\\n(i) the enhanced robustness of strategies due to their runtime-adaptability,\\nand (ii) the compositionality of templates w.r.t. incrementally arriving\\nobjectives. We use control-inspired examples to illustrate these superior\\nproperties of QaSTels for CPS design.   \n",

Concurrently, LLM-judges,\\nmodels trained to generate evaluations and critiques (explanations) in natural\\nlanguage, are becoming increasingly popular in automatic evaluation. Despite\\njudge empirical successes, their effectiveness as evaluators in test-time\\nscaling settings is largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce the Judge\\nEvaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark, which evaluates judge\\nperformance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction\\nfollowing) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam\\nsearch, and critique-based response refinement. We evaluate 10 different judge\\nmodels (7B-70B parameters) for 8 different base generator models (6.7B-72B\\nparameters). Our benchmark shows that while judges are competitive with outcome\\nreward models in reranking, they are consistently worse than process reward\\nmodels in beam search procedures. Furthermore, though unique to LLM-judges,\\ntheir natural language critiques are currently ineffective in guiding the\\ngenerator towards better responses.   \n",

ICL and ICL+BCG fractions, computed across all filters within a 400\\nkpc radius, exhibit a flat trend with wavelength, averaging 28% and 34%,\\nrespectively. Flux ratios between the BCG and the next brightest members\\n(M$_{12}$, M$_{13}$ and M$_{14}$) also display minimal wavelength dependence.\\nThese results indicate that SMACS J0723 is a dynamically evolved cluster with a\\ndominant BCG and well-developed ICL.

These findings support a scenario\\nwhere SMACS J0723's ICL growth is currently driven by galaxy mergers involving\\nthe BCG and other bright satellites, rather than by the accretion of\\npre-processed ICL from a recent cluster merger.

No evidence is found for deuteration of\\naromatic material, with (D/H)$_{\\rm arom} \\lesssim 0.016$: deuteration of the\\naliphatic material exceeds that of the aromatic material by at least a factor\\n10. The observed levels of deuteration may account for the depletion of D\\nobserved in the Galactic interstellar medium. If so, the $4.65\\mu$m feature may\\nbe detectable in absorption.   \n",

Although previous methods\\nhave significantly progressed, especially in training diffusion models on\\nsensitive images with DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), they still\\nsuffer from unsatisfactory performance. In this work, inspired by curriculum\\nlearning, we propose a two-stage DP image synthesis framework, where diffusion\\nmodels learn to generate DP synthetic images from easy to hard. Unlike existing\\nmethods that directly use DP-SGD to train diffusion models, we propose an easy\\nstage in the beginning, where diffusion models learn simple features of the\\nsensitive images. To facilitate this easy stage, we propose to use `central\\nimages', simply aggregations of random samples of the sensitive dataset.\\nIntuitively, although those central images do not show details, they\\ndemonstrate useful characteristics of all images and only incur minimal privacy\\ncosts, thus helping early-phase model training. We conduct experiments to\\npresent that on the average of four investigated image datasets, the fidelity\\nand utility metrics of our synthetic images are 33.1% and 2.1% better than the\\nstate-of-the-art method.   \n",
      "8  In the present work, we aim to restore Book X of the $\\it{Elements}$ to its\\noriginal Theaetetean, pre-Eudoxean form in two separate ways. First, we restore\\nthe considerable mathematical content of Book X, by correlating Book X with\\nPlato's account of Theaetetus' mathematical discoveries and Plato's imitations\\nof these discoveries for his philosophy. Thus, Theaetetus proved (i) the\\neventual periodicity of the anthyphairesis of lines a to b, satisfying $Ma^2 =\\nNb^2$, for MN not square number; (ii) the eventual periodic anthyphairesis of\\nlines a to b, satisfying more general quadratic expressions, including the\\nApplication of Areas in defect, and employing this to show that the 12 classes\\nof alogoi lines, including the minor, despite being alogoi, are determined by\\nan eventually periodic Application of Areas in defect; (iii) the anthyphairetic\\npalindromic periodicity of the anthyphairesis of the surds $\\sqrt{N}$ for any\\nnon-square number N, of relevance to the general Pell's Diophantine problem.\\nSecondly, we restore the proofs of all propositions of Book X, in such way that\\nthese are proofs based on Theaetetus', and not on Eudoxus' theory of proportion\\nof magnitudes, in particular not making any use of Eudoxus' condition (namely\\nof definition 4 of Book V). The restoration is based on our reconstruction of\\nTheaetetus' theory of proportion for magnitudes, for the limited class of\\nratios a/b such that either a, b are commensurable or the anthyphairesis of a\\nto b is eventually periodic, without employing Eudoxus' condition, and its\\nsuccess provides a confirmation of our reconstruction.\\n  The final version of this paper will appear as a chapter in the journal\\nGanita Bh\\=arat\\=i, Bulletin of the Indian Society for History of Mathematics,\\n(2) 45 (2023).   \n",

This transfers the recently introduced\\nconcept of \\emph{Permissive (qualitative) Strategy Templates} (PeSTels) for\\n$\\omega$-regular games to games with quantitative objectives. We provide the\\ntheoretical and algorithmic foundations of (i) QaSTel synthesis, and (ii) their\\n(incremental) combination with PeSTels for games with mixed quantitative and\\nqualitative objectives. Using a prototype implementation of our synthesis\\nalgorithms, we demonstrate empirically that QaSTels extend the advantageous\\nproperties of strategy templates over single winning strategies -- known from\\nPeSTels -- to games with (additional) quantitative objectives. This includes\\n(i) the enhanced robustness of strategies due to their runtime-adaptability,\\nand (ii) the compositionality of templates w.r.t. incrementally arriving\\nobjectives. We use control-inspired examples to illustrate these superior\\nproperties of QaSTels for CPS design.   \n",

Concurrently, LLM-judges,\\nmodels trained to generate evaluations and critiques (explanations) in natural\\nlanguage, are becoming increasingly popular in automatic evaluation. Despite\\njudge empirical successes, their effectiveness as evaluators in test-time\\nscaling settings is largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce the Judge\\nEvaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark, which evaluates judge\\nperformance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction\\nfollowing) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam\\nsearch, and critique-based response refinement. We evaluate 10 different judge\\nmodels (7B-70B parameters) for 8 different base generator models (6.7B-72B\\nparameters). Our benchmark shows that while judges are competitive with outcome\\nreward models in reranking, they are consistently worse than process reward\\nmodels in beam search procedures. Furthermore, though unique to LLM-judges,\\ntheir natural language critiques are currently ineffective in guiding the\\ngenerator towards better responses.\n",

The images were processed\\nfor low surface brightness (LSB) science, with additional correction for\\ninstrumental scattering in the short-wavelength channels, and analysed using\\nwavelet-based decomposition. The ICL, brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and\\nsatellite galaxies were extracted and modelled, with 2D maps for each\\ncomponent. ICL and ICL+BCG fractions, computed across all filters within a 400\\nkpc radius, exhibit a flat trend with wavelength, averaging 28% and 34%,\\nrespectively. Flux ratios between the BCG and the next brightest members\\n(M$_{12}$, M$_{13}$ and M$_{14}$) also display minimal wavelength dependence.\\nThese results indicate that SMACS J0723 is a dynamically evolved cluster with a\\ndominant BCG and well-developed ICL. Five prominent ICL substructures are\\nanalysed, contributing to 10-12% of the total ICL+BCG flux budget, slightly\\nexceeding simulation predictions. Their short dynamical timescales suggest an\\ninstantaneous ICL injection rate of several $10^3 L_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$,\\nconsistent with active dynamical assembly. These findings support a scenario\\nwhere SMACS J0723's ICL growth is currently driven by galaxy mergers involving\\nthe BCG and other bright satellites, rather than by the accretion of\\npre-processed ICL from a recent cluster merger. However, extrapolating the\\ncurrent injection rate to the cluster's lifetime indicates that additional\\nmechanisms are required to match the growth observed in other clusters over\\ncosmic times.\n",

However, grids based on intermittent\\nrenewables are challenged by diurnal and seasonal mismatch between supply of\\nsun and wind and demand for electricity, including for heat pumps and electric\\ntwo and four wheelers. Load management and demand response measures promise to\\nadjust for this mismatch, utilizing information- and price-based approaches to\\nsteer demand towards times with high supply of intermittent renewables. Here,\\nwe systematically review the literature estimating CO2 savings from residential\\nload management in developing and developed nations. We find that load\\nmanagement holds high potential, locally differentiated with energy mix\\n(including the respective share of renewables and fossils), climate zone, and\\nthe regulatory environment and price mechanism. Most identified studies suggest\\na mitigation potential between 1 and 20%. Load management becomes more relevant\\nwith higher shares of intermittent renewables, and when electricity prices are\\nhigh. Importantly, load management aligns consumers' financial incentives with\\nclimate change mitigation, thus rendering accompanying strategies politically\\nfeasible. We summarize key regulatory steps to facilitate load management in\\neconomies and to realize relevant consumer surplus and mitigation potential.\n",

We analyze the friction kernel, revealing power-law tails in the weak\\ncoupling limit and exponential decay in the strong coupling regime. Due to the\\ninterplay between bath interactions, probe-bath coupling, and activity, the\\nmean squared displacement, velocity, and stationary velocity correlations\\nexhibit different dynamical regimes, which we characterize analytically. Under\\nharmonic confinement, we find that energy equipartition holds at low activity\\nbut breaks down at higher activity, with the kinetic energy exhibiting a\\nnon-monotonic dependence on the activity of the bath.\n",

On $\\sim$$50\\,$pc scales,\\ndeuteration levels toward four H$\\,$II regions in M51 are 2-3 times higher than\\nin the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), with implications for the\\nprocesses responsible for the formation and evolution of hydrocarbon\\nnanoparticles, including PAHs. The deuteration of the aliphatic material is\\nfound to anticorrelate with helium ionization in the associated H$\\,$II,\\nsuggesting that harsh FUV radiation may act to lower the deuteration of\\naliphatics in PDRs near massive stars. No evidence is found for deuteration of\\naromatic material, with (D/H)$_{\\rm arom} \\lesssim 0.016$: deuteration of the\\naliphatic material exceeds that of the aromatic material by at least a factor\\n10.

Although previous methods\\nhave significantly progressed, especially in training diffusion models on\\nsensitive images with DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), they still\\nsuffer from unsatisfactory performance. In this work, inspired by curriculum\\nlearning, we propose a two-stage DP image synthesis framework, where diffusion\\nmodels learn to generate DP synthetic images from easy to hard. Unlike existing\\nmethods that directly use DP-SGD to train diffusion models, we propose an easy\\nstage in the beginning, where diffusion models learn simple features of the\\nsensitive images. To facilitate this easy stage, we propose to use `central\\nimages', simply aggregations of random samples of the sensitive dataset.\\nIntuitively, although those central images do not show details, they\\ndemonstrate useful characteristics of all images and only incur minimal privacy\\ncosts, thus helping early-phase model training. We conduct experiments to\\npresent that on the average of four investigated image datasets, the fidelity\\nand utility metrics of our synthetic images are 33.1% and 2.1% better than the\\nstate-of-the-art method.\n",

First, we restore\\nthe considerable mathematical content of Book X, by correlating Book X with\\nPlato's account of Theaetetus' mathematical discoveries and Plato's imitations\\nof these discoveries for his philosophy. Thus, Theaetetus proved (i) the\\neventual periodicity of the anthyphairesis of lines a to b, satisfying $Ma^2 =\\nNb^2$, for MN not square number; (ii) the eventual periodic anthyphairesis of\\nlines a to b, satisfying more general quadratic expressions, including the\\nApplication of Areas in defect, and employing this to show that the 12 classes\\nof alogoi lines, including the minor, despite being alogoi, are determined by\\nan eventually periodic Application of Areas in defect; (iii) the anthyphairetic\\npalindromic periodicity of the anthyphairesis of the surds $\\sqrt{N}$ for any\\nnon-square number N, of relevance to the general Pell's Diophantine problem.\\nSecondly, we restore the proofs of all propositions of Book X, in such way that\\nthese are proofs based on Theaetetus', and not on Eudoxus' theory of proportion\\nof magnitudes, in particular not making any use of Eudoxus' condition (namely\\nof definition 4 of Book V). The restoration is based on our reconstruction of\\nTheaetetus' theory of proportion for magnitudes, for the limited class of\\nratios a/b such that either a, b are commensurable or the anthyphairesis of a\\nto b is eventually periodic, without employing Eudoxus' condition, and its\\nsuccess provides a confirmation of our reconstruction.\\n  The final version of this paper will appear as a chapter in the journal\\nGanita Bh\\=arat\\=i, Bulletin of the Indian Society for History of Mathematics,\\n(2) 45 (2023).\n",

This transfers the recently introduced\\nconcept of \\emph{Permissive (qualitative) Strategy Templates} (PeSTels) for\\n$\\omega$-regular games to games with quantitative objectives. We provide the\\ntheoretical and algorithmic foundations of (i) QaSTel synthesis, and (ii) their\\n(incremental) combination with PeSTels for games with mixed quantitative and\\nqualitative objectives. Using a prototype implementation of our synthesis\\nalgorithms, we demonstrate empirically that QaSTels extend the advantageous\\nproperties of strategy templates over single winning strategies -- known from\\nPeSTels -- to games with (additional) quantitative objectives. This includes\\n(i) the enhanced robustness of strategies due to their runtime-adaptability,\\nand (ii) the compositionality of templates w.r.t. incrementally arriving\\nobjectives. We use control-inspired examples to illustrate these superior\\nproperties of QaSTels for CPS design.\n"

Concurrently, LLM-judges,\\nmodels trained to generate evaluations and critiques (explanations) in natural\\nlanguage, are becoming increasingly popular in automatic evaluation. Despite\\njudge empirical successes, their effectiveness as evaluators in test-time\\nscaling settings is largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce the Judge\\nEvaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark, which evaluates judge\\nperformance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction\\nfollowing) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam\\nsearch, and critique-based response refinement. We evaluate 10 different judge\\nmodels (7B-70B parameters) for 8 different base generator models (6.7B-72B\\nparameters).

The images were processed\\nfor low surface brightness (LSB) science, with additional correction for\\ninstrumental scattering in the short-wavelength channels, and analysed using\\nwavelet-based decomposition. The ICL, brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and\\nsatellite galaxies were extracted and modelled, with 2D maps for each\\ncomponent. ICL and ICL+BCG fractions, computed across all filters within a 400\\nkpc radius, exhibit a flat trend with wavelength, averaging 28% and 34%,\\nrespectively. Flux ratios between the BCG and the next brightest members\\n(M$_{12}$, M$_{13}$ and M$_{14}$) also display minimal wavelength dependence.\\nThese results indicate that SMACS J0723 is a dynamically evolved cluster with a\\ndominant BCG and well-developed ICL. Five prominent ICL substructures are\\nanalysed, contributing to 10-12% of the total ICL+BCG flux budget, slightly\\nexceeding simulation predictions. Their short dynamical timescales suggest an\\ninstantaneous ICL injection rate of several $10^3 L_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$,\\nconsistent with active dynamical assembly. These findings support a scenario\\nwhere SMACS J0723's ICL growth is currently driven by galaxy mergers involving\\nthe BCG and other bright satellites, rather than by the accretion of\\npre-processed ICL from a recent cluster merger. However, extrapolating the\\ncurrent injection rate to the cluster's lifetime indicates that additional\\nmechanisms are required to match the growth observed in other clusters over\\ncosmic times.   \n",

However, grids based on intermittent\\nrenewables are challenged by diurnal and seasonal mismatch between supply of\\nsun and wind and demand for electricity, including for heat pumps and electric\\ntwo and four wheelers. Load management and demand response measures promise to\\nadjust for this mismatch, utilizing information- and price-based approaches to\\nsteer demand towards times with high supply of intermittent renewables. Here,\\nwe systematically review the literature estimating CO2 savings from residential\\nload management in developing and developed nations. We find that load\\nmanagement holds high potential, locally differentiated with energy mix\\n(including the respective share of renewables and fossils), climate zone, and\\nthe regulatory environment and price mechanism. Most identified studies suggest\\na mitigation potential between 1 and 20%. Load management becomes more relevant\\nwith higher shares of intermittent renewables, and when electricity prices are\\nhigh. Importantly, load management aligns consumers' financial incentives with\\nclimate change mitigation, thus rendering accompanying strategies politically\\nfeasible. We summarize key regulatory steps to facilitate load management in\\neconomies and to realize relevant consumer surplus and mitigation potential.   \n",

The deuteration of the aliphatic material is\\nfound to anticorrelate with helium ionization in the associated H$\\,$II,\\nsuggesting that harsh FUV radiation may act to lower the deuteration of\\naliphatics in PDRs near massive stars.

Using a prototype implementation of our synthesis\\nalgorithms, we demonstrate empirically that QaSTels extend the advantageous\\nproperties of strategy templates over single winning strategies -- known from\\nPeSTels -- to games with (additional) quantitative objectives. This includes\\n(i) the enhanced robustness of strategies due to their runtime-adaptability,\\nand (ii) the compositionality of templates w.r.t. incrementally arriving\\nobjectives. We use control-inspired examples to illustrate these superior\\nproperties of QaSTels for CPS design.   \n",

Concurrently, LLM-judges,\\nmodels trained to generate evaluations and critiques (explanations) in natural\\nlanguage, are becoming increasingly popular in automatic evaluation. Despite\\njudge empirical successes, their effectiveness as evaluators in test-time\\nscaling settings is largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce the Judge\\nEvaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark, which evaluates judge\\nperformance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction\\nfollowing) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam\\nsearch, and critique-based response refinement. We evaluate 10 different judge\\nmodels (7B-70B parameters) for 8 different base generator models (6.7B-72B\\nparameters). Our benchmark shows that while judges are competitive with outcome\\nreward models in reranking, they are consistently worse than process reward\\nmodels in beam search procedures. Furthermore, though unique to LLM-judges,\\ntheir natural language critiques are currently ineffective in guiding the\\ngenerator towards better responses.   \n",

The images were processed\\nfor low surface brightness (LSB) science, with additional correction for\\ninstrumental scattering in the short-wavelength channels, and analysed using\\nwavelet-based decomposition. The ICL, brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and\\nsatellite galaxies were extracted and modelled, with 2D maps for each\\ncomponent. ICL and ICL+BCG fractions, computed across all filters within a 400\\nkpc radius, exhibit a flat trend with wavelength, averaging 28% and 34%,\\nrespectively. Flux ratios between the BCG and the next brightest members\\n(M$_{12}$, M$_{13}$ and M$_{14}$) also display minimal wavelength dependence.\\nThese results indicate that SMACS J0723 is a dynamically evolved cluster with a\\ndominant BCG and well-developed ICL. Five prominent ICL substructures are\\nanalysed, contributing to 10-12% of the total ICL+BCG flux budget, slightly\\nexceeding simulation predictions. Their short dynamical timescales suggest an\\ninstantaneous ICL injection rate of several $10^3 L_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$,\\nconsistent with active dynamical assembly. These findings support a scenario\\nwhere SMACS J0723's ICL growth is currently driven by galaxy mergers involving\\nthe BCG and other bright satellites, rather than by the accretion of\\npre-processed ICL from a recent cluster merger. However, extrapolating the\\ncurrent injection rate to the cluster's lifetime indicates that additional\\nmechanisms are required to match the growth observed in other clusters over\\ncosmic times.   \n",

However, grids based on intermittent\\nrenewables are challenged by diurnal and seasonal mismatch between supply of\\nsun and wind and demand for electricity, including for heat pumps and electric\\ntwo and four wheelers. Load management and demand response measures promise to\\nadjust for this mismatch, utilizing information- and price-based approaches to\\nsteer demand towards times with high supply of intermittent renewables. Here,\\nwe systematically review the literature estimating CO2 savings from residential\\nload management in developing and developed nations. We find that load\\nmanagement holds high potential, locally differentiated with energy mix\\n(including the respective share of renewables and fossils), climate zone, and\\nthe regulatory environment and price mechanism. Most identified studies suggest\\na mitigation potential between 1 and 20%. Load management becomes more relevant\\nwith higher shares of intermittent renewables, and when electricity prices are\\nhigh. Importantly, load management aligns consumers' financial incentives with\\nclimate change mitigation, thus rendering accompanying strategies politically\\nfeasible. We summarize key regulatory steps to facilitate load management in\\neconomies and to realize relevant consumer surplus and mitigation potential.   \n",

The deuteration of the aliphatic material is\\nfound to anticorrelate with helium ionization in the associated H$\\,$II,\\nsuggesting that harsh FUV radiation may act to lower the deuteration of\\naliphatics in PDRs near massive stars. No evidence is found for deuteration of\\naromatic material, with (D/H)$_{\\rm arom} \\lesssim 0.016$: deuteration of the\\naliphatic material exceeds that of the aromatic material by at least a factor\\n10.

Although previous methods\\nhave significantly progressed, especially in training diffusion models on\\nsensitive images with DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), they still\\nsuffer from unsatisfactory performance. In this work, inspired by curriculum\\nlearning, we propose a two-stage DP image synthesis framework, where diffusion\\nmodels learn to generate DP synthetic images from easy to hard. Unlike existing\\nmethods that directly use DP-SGD to train diffusion models, we propose an easy\\nstage in the beginning, where diffusion models learn simple features of the\\nsensitive images. To facilitate this easy stage, we propose to use `central\\nimages', simply aggregations of random samples of the sensitive dataset.\\nIntuitively, although those central images do not show details, they\\ndemonstrate useful characteristics of all images and only incur minimal privacy\\ncosts, thus helping early-phase model training. We conduct experiments to\\npresent that on the average of four investigated image datasets, the fidelity\\nand utility metrics of our synthetic images are 33.1% and 2.1% better than the\\nstate-of-the-art method.   \n",
      "8  The restoration of Book X of the Elements to its original Theaetetean\\n  form [SUMMARY] In the present work, we aim to restore Book X of the $\\it{Elements}$ to its\\noriginal Theaetetean, pre-Eudoxean form in two separate ways. First, we restore\\nthe considerable mathematical content of Book X, by correlating Book X with\\nPlato's account of Theaetetus' mathematical discoveries and Plato's imitations\\nof these discoveries for his philosophy. Thus, Theaetetus proved (i) the\\neventual periodicity of the anthyphairesis of lines a to b, satisfying $Ma^2 =\\nNb^2$, for MN not square number; (ii) the eventual periodic anthyphairesis of\\nlines a to b, satisfying more general quadratic expressions, including the\\nApplication of Areas in defect, and employing this to show that the 12 classes\\nof alogoi lines, including the minor, despite being alogoi, are determined by\\nan eventually periodic Application of Areas in defect; (iii) the anthyphairetic\\npalindromic periodicity of the anthyphairesis of the surds $\\sqrt{N}$ for any\\nnon-square number N, of relevance to the general Pell's Diophantine problem.\\nSecondly, we restore the proofs of all propositions of Book X, in such way that\\nthese are proofs based on Theaetetus', and not on Eudoxus' theory of proportion\\nof magnitudes, in particular not making any use of Eudoxus' condition (namely\\nof definition 4 of Book V). The restoration is based on our reconstruction of\\nTheaetetus' theory of proportion for magnitudes, for the limited class of\\nratios a/b such that either a, b are commensurable or the anthyphairesis of a\\nto b is eventually periodic, without employing Eudoxus' condition, and its\\nsuccess provides a confirmation of our reconstruction.\\n  The final version of this paper will appear as a chapter in the journal\\nGanita Bh\\=arat\\=i, Bulletin of the Indian Society for History of Mathematics,\\n(2) 45 (2023).   \n",

This transfers the recently introduced\\nconcept of \\emph{Permissive (qualitative) Strategy Templates} (PeSTels) for\\n$\\omega$-regular games to games with quantitative objectives. We provide the\\ntheoretical and algorithmic foundations of (i) QaSTel synthesis, and (ii) their\\n(incremental) combination with PeSTels for games with mixed quantitative and\\nqualitative objectives. Using a prototype implementation of our synthesis\\nalgorithms, we demonstrate empirically that QaSTels extend the advantageous\\nproperties of strategy templates over single winning strategies -- known from\\nPeSTels -- to games with (additional) quantitative objectives. This includes\\n(i) the enhanced robustness of strategies due to their runtime-adaptability,\\nand (ii) the compositionality of templates w.r.t. incrementally arriving\\nobjectives. We use control-inspired examples to illustrate these superior\\nproperties of QaSTels for CPS design.   \n",
