      "|robust entangled photon generation by floquetengineered twocolour pulses summary quantum emitters driven by resonant twophoton excitation are a leading source for deterministically generated entangled photon pairs essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies however conventional resonant schemes are highly sensitive to laser power fluctuations and pose additional experimental challenges for emitters with small biexciton binding energies here we demonstrate how biexciton preparation schemes with significantly improved robustness and reduced laser filtering requirements can be identified using a novel design principle beyond resonant and adiabatic driving ultrafast alloptical floquet engineering this is achieved by employing two strongly and symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulses whose superposition generates a stroboscopic hamiltonian that enables direct coupling between ground and biexciton states moreover a pulse delay serves as a tuning knob introducing an effective magnetic field that concentrates the bloch sphere trajectory at the biexciton state for a wide range of parameters making biexciton preparation particularly robust experimentally we achieve a biexciton occupation exceeding and preserve photonpair entanglement with a fidelity of our scheme highlights the great impact of floquetengineered multicolour excitation protocols for ondemand quantum light sources                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |quant-ph          |physics      |\n",
      "|a settheoretic robust control approach for linear quadratic games with unknown counterparts summary ensuring robust decisionmaking in multiagent systems is challenging when agents have distinct possibly conflicting objectives and lack full knowledge of each other s strategies this is apparent in safetycritical applications such as humanrobot interaction and assisted driving where uncertainty arises not only from unknown adversary strategies but also from external disturbances to address this the paper proposes a robust adaptive control approach based on linear quadratic differential games our method allows a controlled agent to iteratively refine its belief about the adversary strategy and disturbances using a setmembership approach while simultaneously adapting its policy to guarantee robustness against the uncertain adversary policy and improve performance over time we formally derive theoretical guarantees on the robustness of the proposed control scheme and its convergence to epsilonnash strategies the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in a numerical simulation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |eess.SY           |eess         |\n",
